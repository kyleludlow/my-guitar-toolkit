#Quick REST API Node Server For Frontend Testing

This is a light REST API Node server without a database for quickly testing asynchronous frontend code. A todo list is used as an example, but the model can easily be changed to emulate your app's needs.

This code, as is all my code, is formatted using [StandardJS](https://github.com/feross/standard) style guidelines.

## Dependencies
* express
* body-parser
* underscore
